  \ different types. You\u2019ll extract letters and numbers into distinct groups,\
  \ preserving their flow from the source."
- 'In this activity, you''ll need to categorize items from a provided list into two
  distinct sections: letters first and then numbers, all the while ensuring that the
  order remains as it was in the input.'
- You will analyze a mixed input list to sort its contents by gathering alphabetic
  items throughout the beginning of your response followed by numeric items at the
  end.
- This exercise consists of identifying alphabetical items from numerical ones in
  an input list. Your aim is to create a new structured format with letters first
  followed by numbers based on their sequential entry.
- 'This task requires you to identify and arrange the elements of an input list into
  two distinct groups: alphabetical and numerical.'
- The objective is to rearrange a provided list of items, distinguishing between alphabetical
  components and numerical ones. List all letters first in their initial order followed
  by the numbers also in their original sequence.
- You must analyze an array of elements and divide them into two categories, ensuring
  that each retains its initial sequence as presented.
- This task challenges your ability to categorize data by type. From a provided list
  containing letters and numbers, you must extract and order them correctly based
  on their classification.
- You'll be collating information from a list. Specifically, extract all alphabetic
  entries and list them before any numbers, maintaining their order as they appeared
  originally.
- Your goal here is to manage a series of mixed items effectively, splitting them
  into two groups where alphabetical elements precede their numeric counterparts.
- "You'll need to look at a list containing various characters and systematically\
  \ arrange its components by type \u2014 first listing all letters and then the numbers,\
  \ respecting their order of appearance."
- The aim here is to sort through a range of items in a list, pulling out alphabetical
  characters first and then listing numerical elements, while upholding their existing
  order.
- The task involves analyzing a character array made up of various letters and numbers.
  Sort these characters such that all letter entries are listed sequentially before
  any numeric entries appear.
