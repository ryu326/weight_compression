  to essential camping supplies, focusing on identifying when participants express
  thoughts aimed at addressing other people's requirements.
- You will analyze conversational turns between two negotiators at a campsite. Pay
  attention to whether an utterance conveys an other-need strategy, indicating that

  resources. Your job is to spot mentions of external needs, indicating a particular
  negotiation strategy highlighted in their dialogues.

  \ if any utterance presents a selfish negotiation strategy related to someone else\u2019\
